# Welcome!

Our team meets on Tuesdays in rooms Taub 8 & Taub 9. Our meetings typically consist of a 15-minute keynote, after which we split into two tracks:
- **Getting Started** - introductory lectures followed by solving beginner CTFs.
- **Competition Preparation** - solving advanced CTFs in preparation for competitions.
